This is reimplementation of the Amharic Metaphone algorithm
of the Text-TransMetaphone package.  This implementation uses
an object oriented interface and will generate keys in
Ethiopic script by default.  IPA keys remain available and
may be set at instantiation time or afterwards.  See the POD
for details.

The Ethiopic keys are by far the easiest to read and associate
with the initial word (this aids development).  ASCII keys may
eventually be implemented, but will require a bit of care and
thought.
